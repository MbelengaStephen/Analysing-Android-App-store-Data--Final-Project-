#### Introduction

I'll investigate some of the data from app store analytics provided by companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower that helps inform development and app marketing strategies for many companies.

####  Data wrangling Steps:

1. Remove unused columns, NaN values and Duplicates.
2. Remove unwanted symbols and convert data into numeric format.
3. Wrangle columns containing nested data with Pandas.
